## Introduction
The Mano Computer is a simple computer architecture designed by Charles R. Mano. It consists of a central processing unit (CPU), memory, and input/output devices. In this project, we have implemented the Mano Computer in Proteus, a simulation software.

## Architecture
The Mano Computer architecture consists of the following components:
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Control Unit
- Memory Unit
- Input/Output (I/O) Unit

## Instructions
The Mano Computer supports a set of instructions, including:
- Load and Store instructions
- Arithmetic and Logic instructions
- Branch instructions
- Input and Output instructions

For a detailed list of instructions and their opcodes, please refer to the [instruction set documentation](./docs/instruction-set.md).

## Usage
To use the Mano Computer simulation in Proteus, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Proteus and create a new project.
3. Import the Mano Computer circuit file (`Mano Computer.pdsprj`) into your Proteus project.
4. Connect the necessary input and output devices to the Mano Computer circuit.
5. Run the simulation and observe the execution of the program.

For more detailed instructions on setting up and running the simulation, please refer to the [user manual](./docs/user-manual.md).
